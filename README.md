# minishell

Minishell made by https://github.com/epanholz and me!
It's a project that recreates the beloved unix shell <3 It's wayyy dumber than the original, but it does look cooler.

Notes:
Most common compile error is the readline lib, so change the path in the Makefile.

////////It's evangelion themed.//////////

To change eva type one of these commands:
eva-00,
eva-01 or
eva-02

There is also a lil dmysys mode for the true weebs, where you lose control and everything errors hehe...
To get out just change back to the eva's by typing one of the three mods above.
